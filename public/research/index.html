<p class="message">
    My research considers the role of ideas about work in shaping American democratic thought. In particular, I focus on the writing of key figures in the Progressive Era. Looking at Jane Addams, Herbert Croly, John Dewey, and W.E.B. Du Bois, I argue that work was central to their individual conceptions of democracy. Although this aspect was shared in common among these thinkers, I argue that each elaborated a distinct work ethic. Far from a monolithic concept, the work ethic is heterogeneous. Far from being the province of any one ideological commitment, it can support a range of political positions.

<p>This article explores the meaning of work for American democracy through a study of the writings of the Progressive political theorist Herbert Croly. Drawing primarily on his two principal political writings, <em>The Promise of American Life</em> and <em>Progressive Democracy</em>, the article interprets his political thought as an attempt to realize democracy by changing the way Americans think about work. Close attention is paid to his views on three topics: occupation, specialization, and administrative organization. According to Croly, a reconceptualization of work could correct the atomizing and conformist tendencies of modern industrial life, could enhance the efficiency and increase the productivity of both managers and workers, and could facilitate the development of an administrative state that would distribute labor in response to public desires and needs. The essay concludes with a discussion of how Croly can help us understand the political challenges and possibilities posed by the contemporary American experience of work.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0034670513000314">Jane Addams on the Meaning of Work</a></h2>

<p>By exploring Addams&rsquo;s lifelong fascination with work, this essay analyzes the ways in which her understanding of work fundamentally shaped her wider political vision. For Addams, work was the foundation of not only a personal sense of identity, but also a collective democratic character. The workplace had the potential to be the model of a cooperative community, providing a venue for social solidarity and civic reciprocity. By working together, Americans would develop a more cosmopolitan and inclusive politics. In short, the essay argues that Addams&rsquo;s political thought was an attempt to revitalize democracy by giving meaning to work. It concludes by suggesting that her arguments can be applied to many contemporary political problems, and that today&rsquo;s democratic theory and practice would be enlivened by a renewed attention to work.</p>
