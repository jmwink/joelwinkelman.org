## [Introduction to Political Theory](http://joelwinkelman.org/assets/govt117.pdf)

This course introduces major figures and concepts in the history of political thought. Through readings that span the history of Western thought from the ancients to the 20th century, we will consider questions about who should rule, the scope of political authority, and the meaning of justice. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to (1) articlute the ideas of some of the major figures in the canon of political theory; (2) assess critically a scholarly interpretation of a text in political theory; (3) adduce evidence to develop their own interpertation of a theorist or text; (4) interpret a contemporary political phenomenon through the lens of a theorist or text.

## [American Political Thought](http://joelwinkelman.org/assets/govt249.pdf)

This course surveys the history of American ideas from the colonial encounter through the late 20th century. Primary readings introduce major figures from Puritan leaders and Constitutional founders to social scientists and political activists. We will examine how Americans have understood the concepts of (among others) authority, political membership, equality, and liberty. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to (1) articulate the ideas of major figures in American political thought; (2) assess critically a scholarly interpretation of a text in American political thought; (3) explain how political concepts have changed over time; (4) interpret the contemporary meaning of political concepts.

## [Political Theory and the Environment](http://joelwinkelman.org/assets/govt287.pdf)

Engaging primary texts from the liberal, agrarian/communitarian, and pragmatist schools of thought, this course explores each approach's conception of nature and the environment. The course examines how each approach responds to the problems of political membership, the role of experts in a democracy, and the relationship between state power and the environment. It also includes journalistic accounts of contemporary environmental issues to situate course readings in the real world. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to (1) describe and explain three major approaches to the environment in political theory; (2) explain the consequences of each approach in framing or addressing an environmental problem; (3) articulate and defend criteria to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach; (4) identify their own approach to the environment.

## [Capitalism, Democracy, and the Workplace](http://joelwinkelman.org/assets/govt389.pdf)

What is the relationship between capitalism and democracy? Should the claims of democracy extend into the workplace? What would it mean to democratically organize work? Engaging students in original research projects, this course ask students to consider these and related questions. The course begins with a survey of the history of ideas about work; proceeds through empirical and legal studies of the relationship between capitalism, democracy, and work; and concludes with two contemporary normative analyses of today's working life. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to (1) define a research question in political theory; (2) assess critically a scholarly interpretation of a text in political theory; (3) adduce evidence to develop their own interpertation of a theorist's or text's understanding of concepts related to work; (4) apply this interpretation to a contemporary economic or political problem related to work; (5) draw normative or interpretive conclusions from this interpretation; (6) present their research findings to an audience of peers. 

## [Interpreting the U.S. Environment](http://joelwinkelman.org/assets/es250.pdf)

This course explores conceptions of the American environment beginning with the colonial encounter, moving through the development and exhaustion of the Western landscape, and ending in the chaotic environs of the postmodern city. Readings include primary documents, academic histories, novels, and journalistic accounts of the American environment. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: (1) describe and explain four major interpretations of the U.S. environment; (2) identify concrete social, political, and economic practices that these interpretations have enabled; (3) evaluate the effects of these practices on the environment itself; (4) formulate their own interpretation of their lived environment.
