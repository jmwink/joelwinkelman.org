My research considers the role of ideas about work in shaping American democratic thought. In particular, I focus on the writing of key figures in the Progressive Era. Looking at Jane Addams, Herbert Croly, John Dewey, and W.E.B. Du Bois, I argue that work was central to their individual conceptions of democracy. Although this aspect was shared in common among these thinkers, I argue that each elaborated a distinct work ethic. Far from a monolithic concept, the work ethic is heterogeneous. Far from being the province of any one ideological commitment, it can support a range of political positions.
