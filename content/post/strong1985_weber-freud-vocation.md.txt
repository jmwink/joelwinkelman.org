## Tracy Strong, “Weber and Freud: Vocation and Self-acknowledgement,” *The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie* 10 (Autumn, 1985), pp. 391--409


Strong gives a basically existentialist view of vocation in the thought of Weber and Freud. Strong argues that for Weber, vocation is the sense of acknowledgement of where one stands in history. Specifically, it means to have accepted one’s historical sociology as a part of oneself. In the vocation of science, it is to accept the division of labor, the rise of specialization, the demystification of reality that one’s labor advances, and the end of childishness. It is the loss of innocence, and the understanding of one’s own role in that loss, and in the loss of others’ innocence. Strong also claims that it is the acceptance of oneself as a bourgeois. 


Freud has a similar view of self-acknowledgement. It has something to do with honesty to oneself, and something to do with self-construction. But it is not entirely clear that vocation in this sense is available to anyone other than the psychoanalyst. The essay is much weaker on Freud than it is on Weber, but its a helpful exposition of Weber’s view on vocation.
