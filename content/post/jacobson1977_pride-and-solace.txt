## Norman Jacobson, *Pride & Solace: The Functions and Limits of Political Theory* (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1977).

This book collects Norman Jacobson's introductory lectures in political theory, offering readings of Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau. The study of the three critical moderns are framed with an introduction and conclusion that explore the meaning of political theory to a world in crisis. The essays are meant to inspire students, and they do just that. 

The introductory essay suggests that the enterprise of political theory has historically been to create a public solution to a private problem, one in the soul or psyche of the theorist. Jacobson sees the theorist as a heroic figure (not unlike Wolin's epic theorist) who recognize that "the civic god is dead," and strive to resurrect it. The task of theory is to put a new name on the civic god. The theorist is torn between the figure of the Grand Inquisitor and the Prophet, between letting the public in on the secret that there is no god and giving them a new one to worship. But the prophet also slips into the role of the legislator, following the tradition of Moses. The trouble for the modern theorist is the challenge of anti-foundationalism, and the rejection of any fixed principles---the assumption that everyone should figure it out for themselves.
