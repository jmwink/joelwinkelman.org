### Thomas Bender, "E.R.A. Seligman and the Vocation of Social Science" in *Intellect and Public Life: Essays on the Social History of Academic Intellectuals in the United States* (Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), 49--77.

Thomas Bender is a fine intellectual historian whose books and essays have been very helpful in my own writing. This essay is a local history of social science in New York from 1904--1930. Bender describes a conflict among elitist, activist, and disinterested social scientists. [E.R.A. Seligman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Robert_Anderson_Seligman) represents the elitist model of social science, which conceived experts as advisers to leaders. The activist strand is represented by [Daniel DeLeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_De_Leon) whose political career overshadowed his brief academic career. Though hardly aloof from the concerns of the day, [Thorstein Veblen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen) saw scholars in service to neither the mass movements nor to the leaders of business and government but to the truth itself. The elitist model emerged victorious, though the conflict was not without its casualties.
