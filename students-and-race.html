<p>This semester, I gave my students the assignment of challenging one of the seven stated premises of the course syllabus. The most popular one to challenge was the premise that race was the most important factor in American politics. The students who challenged this one were uniformly white, male, and most were athletes. While many of them chose to challenge the premise with an argument that race is far less important than class, it seemed like the feeling beneath each was a reluctance to take black experience seriously.</p>

<p>But why the reluctance? On the one hand, it’s tempting to assume that these students simply don’t like black people. After all, it’s likely that all of them grew up in the typically segregated geography that sees in blackness depressed housing prices. On the other hand, this explanation probably applies to nearly all of the other students in class. Most students probably have similarly little exposure to black American life and culture but chose to engage a different argument. So, how do we explain these students desire avoid taking race seriously?</p>

<p>I don’t think these students are simply hostile, unthinking, or unkind. Rather, I think they are announcing that they don’t understand something and find themselves without any secure cover for their ignorance beyond pride. <span id="%" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></span>
      <span class="sidenote">Besides, they are expressing opinions that have the imprimatur of the intellectual establishment. They can even choose from a menu of emotional flavors: <em>The New Republic</em> (swaggering and bellicose), <em>The Atlantic</em> (concern-trolling) and <em>The New Yorker</em> (arch resignation).</span> So, we meet them where they are, and ask them to be more rigorous and systematic about how they are conceiving of the problem. Instead of shaming them for their ignorance, we help them find their own pathway through the problem. Their movement might be slow and small, but it will be theirs. And we will have addressed what they are actually asking us, not telling them what we want to hear ourselves saying.</p>
